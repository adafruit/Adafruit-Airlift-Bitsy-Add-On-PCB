### Description

Give your ItsyBitsy project a lift with the Adafruit AirLift Bitsy Add-On; - it's the first add-on for the ItsyBitsy and it lets you use the powerful ESP32 as a WiFi co-processor. You probably have your favorite ItsyBitsy (like the [ItsyBitsy M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800)) that comes with its own set of awesome peripherals and lots of libraries. But it doesn't have WiFi built in! So let's give that chip a best friend, the ESP32. This chip can handle all the heavy lifting of connecting to a WiFi network and transferring data from a site, even if its using the latest TLS/SSL encryption (it has root certificates pre-burned in).
